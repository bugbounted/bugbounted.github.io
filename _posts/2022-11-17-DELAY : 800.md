Everyone! It’s almost the end of the year. It’s nearing that time when we arbitrarily decide we’re going to turn over a new leaf; start a new great habit. But so many of us embark on this process without once considering our baseline — where we’re starting from.

I want to introduce you to a process I’ve used the past couple of years, one I really like. It’s such a pain-free process, but it’s also a remarkably revealing look at what matters to you, and your life. Ready? Here we go.

# Some background

In 2020, I joined an online community called Ness Labs. The brainchild of Anne-Laure Le Cunff, [Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/) is a community of over 50,000 global learners, people who call themselves knowledge workers. I was a member for a year and am about to re-up my subscription.

The beauty of Ness Labs, for me, was its internationality. One tiny example: In a weekly Pomodoro meeting created by a fellow Ness Labs member, we had members from Asia, from Europe, from the United States. We learned a lot from each other, and I’ve definitely reaped the fruits of that productivity. A solid draft of my forthcoming novel was written during those Pomodoros!

We also met up for classes. One of them was about a year-end review, and it was so fruitful I immediately passed the technique on to others. Now I’m passing it on to you.

# The backbone of the technique

There are two primary things you have to remember when you’re using this technique:

* Keep it simple
* Set a time limit

Here’s the technique itself: Everything falls into one of three status markers — a plus (what went well); a minus (what didn’t go so well); or an arrow forward (what can you do better next time?). It’s worth noting that “what can you do better next time?” isn’t about the things you want to _stop_ doing, but also about the things you want to _keep_ doing.

This technique makes good use of the four questions the [ShelterBox](https://www.shelterboxusa.org/) disaster-relief team I volunteer for asks itself every evening during our debriefs on active deployments:

* What went well?
* What didn’t go so well?
* What would we do differently?
* What did we learn?

(We’ll tackle that last question later on in this process, too.)

Using either the plus, the minus, or the forward arrow, you assess nine different categories:

* Health and Fitness
* Work and Business
* Personal Life
* Friends and Community
* Learning and Knowledge
* Travel and Culture (how much did you _explore_?)
* Hobbies and Creativity (how did you nurture your creative side?)
* Emotions and Spirituality (how did you connect with your inner self?)
* Money and Finances

Your worksheet should look something like this:

Yours will look lovelier than mine. I like to dedicate a page to each category, by the way, but then again, I like a lot of space.

Make a page like this, or a diagram like this, for each of the nine categories. Then set a timer and go.

# Some tips for success

Keep this process intuitive. Don’t overthink each column, just write or type. (For what it’s worth, I find hand-writing works much better with this exercise.)

I’ve also found this works really well as a group activity. Much like our group Pomodoros, I found being part of a community lifted my spirits and kept me engaged.

# Where do you go from here?

Okay! So now you have this fancy chart with lots of scribblings on it. What do you do now with it? Save it, obviously, and Le Cunff has some further tips:

* List your three biggest accomplishments
* List your three biggest challenges
* List your six main goals for the next year

(I didn’t ask her what these numbers were about, but it’s worth noting that our brains like to see things in thirds, and we think that three of anything makes a pattern.)

She also suggested the following forward movements:

* Expand on your pluses, minuses, and forward actions
* Turn your chart and findings into a journal entry or blog post

And this is where the fourth question that we employ at ShelterBox, the question of what we learned, comes into play. I think you’ll find that the more you muse and look at what you’ve done over the year, the more you’ll find things to learn from it — about yourself, the way you grow, and the life you want to lead.
